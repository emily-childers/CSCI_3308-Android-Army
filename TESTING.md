Automated Tests: Explanation and Screenshot (see above) <br />
User Acceptance Tests: 
1. User will insert data into the database in the submit page and check if the phone page includes the change. To specifically test this, we use a process very similar to Lab 8. First, we link a PHP Insert Handler file to the html file for our submission page. Upon filling out manufacturer name, phone model, OS Release, security and version name, we press the submit button and initially test using print statements. If the connection to our MySQL database is succesful, a print statement will appear saying so. In addition to these print statements, we will manually check the database to see if it is updates. Our "Phones" page will also act like the "store.php" page did in Lab 8, displaying all the databases. If our submission is succesful, it will appear in the tables on the "Phones" page. <br />
2. User will insert data into the contact page and administor gets the email. <br />
3. User will search for a phone using the search bar and be navigated to the details page. <br />
